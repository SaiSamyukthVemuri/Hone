# 12 Smoke tests

This is the catalogue of manual smoke tests every operator and reviewer should know how to run. Some can be executed from a curl loop; many require an authenticated practitioner session and a real test appointment and cannot be done from CI or from an AI harness.

Use [docs/11 Runbook](./11_RUNBOOK.md) for the SQL recipes referenced below.

## 1. Public booking smoke

1. Open `https://hone.care/book/willow-electrolysis`. Expect `200`.
2. Pick "Next available day". Expect a date with at least one slot.
3. Fill the form as a new client. Verify the service picker only shows consultation modalities.
4. Submit. Expect a confirmation banner and a confirmation email in the inbox.
5. SQL:
   ```sql
   select id, status, starts_at, cancellation_token,
          confirmation_send_attempts, confirmation_sent_at
     from public.appointments
    where studio_id = '<studio uuid>'
    order by created_at desc
    limit 5;
   ```
   Expected: new row, `status='confirmed'`, `cancellation_token` non-null, `confirmation_send_attempts >= 1`, `confirmation_sent_at` populated.

## 2. Portal smoke

1. Request a magic link at `/portal/login?studio=willow-electrolysis` for a test client.
2. Confirm the email arrives and the link points to `https://hone.care/portal/verify/<token>`.
3. Open the link in a fresh incognito window. Confirm GET is non-consuming (page renders the Continue form).
4. Click Continue. Confirm landing on `/portal` with the two-zone layout (Needs you / Your info).
5. Verify the cookie `hone_portal_session` is httpOnly + secure.
6. Sign out by clearing the cookie. Confirm `/portal/messages` redirects when anonymous.

## 3. Consent smoke (treatment + photo)

1. As the studio owner in `/settings/consent`, create or activate a `treatment_consent` template.
2. As a test client in `/portal`, sign the form (type your name + submit).
3. SQL:
   ```sql
   select id, template_title_snapshot, template_version, template_hash,
          signature_name, signed_at, response
     from public.client_consent_signatures
    where studio_id = '<studio uuid>' and client_id = '<client uuid>'
    order by signed_at desc;
   ```
   Expected: new row with the title/body/version snapshot, `signature_name` populated, `signed_at` recent.
4. Repeat for a `photo_consent` template.

## 4. Photo denial smoke (PR #137)

1. From a test client's `/portal`, find an active `photo_consent` form.
2. Click "Deny" (or the equivalent UI button).
3. SQL: the new `client_consent_signatures` row carries `response='denied'` and a `response_label_snapshot` describing the deny copy. The signature is real, not absent.

## 5. Card-on-file smoke (test mode)

See [docs/11 Stripe card-on-file smoke](./11_RUNBOOK.md#stripe-card-on-file-smoke-test-mode). Use Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`.

Expected end state:
- One `client_payment_methods` row with `status='active'`, `stripe_livemode=false`, valid Stripe ids, non-null `card_authorization_signature_id`.
- One `stripe_events` row for `setup_intent.succeeded` with `processed_at` set and no `processing_error`.
- The portal "Your info" zone shows `Visa ending in 4242`.

## 6. Cancellation reason smoke (PR #144)

1. From a test booked appointment, open the cancel link `/cancel/<token>`.
2. Pick "Schedule changed" from the reason dropdown. Verify the reschedule nudge appears with a `Reschedule instead` button.
3. Click the button. Confirm `/reschedule/<token>` opens.
4. Return to the cancel link. Pick "Schedule changed" again. Add a note. Check the follow-up-allowed box. Submit.
5. SQL:
   ```sql
   select action, actor_type, details, created_at
     from public.appointment_audit
    where action = 'cancelled'
    order by created_at desc
    limit 5;
   ```
   Expected: top row has `details = {"source": "public_token", "reason": "schedule_changed", "reason_label": "Schedule changed", "note": "<your note>", "follow_up_allowed": true}`.
6. Open the appointment in `/calendar/<id>` (signed in as practitioner). Confirm:
   - "Cancellation reason: Schedule changed".
   - "Client note: <your note>".
   - "Follow-up okay" badge.
   - "Cancelled N minutes after booking" if `cancelled_at - created_at <= 15 minutes`.

## 7. Calendar block smoke (PR #139 + #140)

1. As an active non-owner practitioner (if available; otherwise the owner), open `/calendar`.
2. Drag to select a window. Pick "Block time" from the chooser.
3. Confirm the block renders with the warm-tan style (PR #138).
4. Open `/book/<slug>` and the studio's booking horizon date that overlaps the block. Confirm the blocked time is NOT offered as a bookable slot.
5. Repeat with an all-day block. Confirm the block synthesises `[utc(date 00:00), utc(date+1 00:00))` (no extra calendar day swept up).

## 8. Fee protection smoke (PR #145)

1. As owner in `/settings/payments`, set both `late_cancel_fee_cents` and `no_show_fee_cents` to non-zero values via the FeeAmountsCard.
2. Open a cancelled appointment with full evidence (active card, signed authorization, policy ack). The "Cancellation/no-show fee" card should show the eligible preview on the Late cancellation tab and block on the No-show tab with "No-show fee requires a no-show appointment."
3. Try Prepare with no internal note → blocked (client-side disable + server-side `NOTE_REQUIRED_ERROR`).
4. Add note + Prepare → success card "Manual charge prepared. No money has been charged yet."
5. SQL:
   ```sql
   select id, charge_type, status, amount_cents, currency,
          internal_note, timing_classification, created_at
     from public.manual_fee_charge_attempts
    order by created_at desc
    limit 5;
   ```
   Expected: new row with `status='ready'`, `timing_classification='practitioner_asserted'`, your note populated.
6. Set both fee amounts to NULL or 0. Confirm the eligible preview disappears and the blocked panel reads "Late cancellation fee amount is not configured."

## 9. Test-mode manual fee charge smoke (PR #146)

Critical money-adjacent path.

1. Pre-conditions: a `ready` attempt exists from §8 above. Stripe is in test mode (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` starts with `sk_test_`).
2. On the appointment detail page, click "Run test charge".
3. Wait for the success card to render.
4. SQL:
   ```sql
   select id, status, stripe_livemode,
          stripe_payment_intent_id, stripe_charge_id,
          stripe_idempotency_key, charged_at
     from public.manual_fee_charge_attempts
    where id = '<attempt uuid>';
   ```
   Expected: `status='succeeded'`, `stripe_livemode=false`, `stripe_payment_intent_id` populated, `stripe_charge_id` populated, `stripe_idempotency_key = 'hone:manual-fee:<attempt-id>:v1'`, `charged_at` set.
5. Stripe Dashboard → Payments under the connected account: exactly one PaymentIntent + Charge with metadata `hone_manual_fee_charge_attempt_id=<your id>`, `hone_environment=test`.
6. Click "Run test charge" again on the same now-succeeded row. The action short-circuits via `already_succeeded`. Stripe Dashboard shows still exactly one PaymentIntent.
7. Refresh the appointment detail page (simulating a network blip mid-action). Confirm the success panel reads the same `stripe_payment_intent_id`.
8. Prepare a separate `ready` attempt on a different appointment. Click "Cancel prepared fee" with a reason. Confirm:
   - Row flips to `status='cancelled'`.
   - `stripe_payment_intent_id` stays NULL.
   - No Stripe call (verify in dashboard).
9. Confirm no email/SMS receipt was sent (none should be; no receipt code exists today).
10. Confirm no live payment exists.

## 9b. Public reschedule safety smoke (PR #149)

Critical safety path. Public reschedule must match public booking on past-slot handling and must never expose raw DB or RPC errors.

1. Create a test appointment in the future. Open its `/reschedule/<token>` link.
2. Confirm the summary loads and slots render.
3. Pick **today** as the date. Confirm slots earlier than or equal to now are NOT offered.
4. Submit a forged form with `newStartsAt <= now()` (browser devtools edit the value attribute on a hidden field or POST directly). Confirm the response is the generic "This reschedule link can't be used right now." copy with no raw Postgres or function-name text.
5. Cancel the original appointment via `/cancel/<token>`. Re-open `/reschedule/<token>`. Confirm the page renders the generic unavailable surface and `/reschedule/<token>`'s read actions do not return the appointment summary.
6. Mark another future appointment `completed` and another `no_show` (via the practitioner calendar lifecycle). Re-open each one's reschedule link. Confirm the same generic behavior.
7. SQL check after a successful reschedule:
   ```sql
   select id, status, starts_at, cancellation_reason, cancelled_at,
          cancelled_by, cancellation_token, updated_at
     from public.appointments
    where studio_id = '<studio uuid>'
      and (id = '<original id>' or starts_at = '<new starts_at>')
    order by updated_at desc;
   ```
   Expected: original row has `status='cancelled'`, `cancellation_reason='Rescheduled via email link'`. New row has `status='confirmed'` and a new `cancellation_token`.
8. SQL check the RPC source carries both guards:
   ```sql
   select pg_get_functiondef(p.oid)
     from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
    where n.nspname='public' and p.proname='reschedule_appointment';
   ```
   Expected substring matches:
   - `v_original.starts_at <= now()`
   - `p_new_starts_at <= now()`
9. Run the local automated test harness against the action's source file:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Expected: every test in `tests/app/reschedule/error-sanitization.test.ts`, `tests/app/reschedule/submitted-start-guard.test.ts`, and `tests/lib/booking/slots-filter-future.test.ts` passes. These pin down "no raw .message leak", "strict > now()" comparison, and the shared future-slot filter.

## 10. Security route smoke

```bash
echo "=== Anonymous routes ==="
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "/book/willow-electrolysis %{http_code}\n" \
  "https://hone.care/book/willow-electrolysis"
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "/calendar %{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n" \
  "https://hone.care/calendar"
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "/settings/payments %{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n" \
  "https://hone.care/settings/payments"
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "/portal %{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n" \
  "https://hone.care/portal"
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "/portal/messages %{http_code} -> %{redirect_url}\n" \
  "https://hone.care/portal/messages"

echo "=== Token route privacy headers ==="
for p in /cancel /reschedule /manage /intake /portal/verify; do
  echo "${p}/fake:"
  curl -sI "https://hone.care${p}/fake" \
    | grep -iE '^(HTTP|x-robots-tag|referrer-policy)'
done

echo "=== /calendar-feed/fake.ics has the same headers ==="
curl -sI "https://hone.care/calendar-feed/fake.ics" \
  | grep -iE '^(HTTP|x-robots-tag|referrer-policy)'
```

Expected:

| Route | HTTP | Redirect / headers |
|---|---|---|
| `/book/willow-electrolysis` | `200` | n/a |
| `/calendar` | `307` | `/login` |
| `/settings/payments` | `307` | `/login` |
| `/portal` | `307` | `/portal/login` |
| `/portal/messages` | `307` | `/login` |
| `/cancel/fake` | `200` | `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` |
| `/reschedule/fake` | `200` | same |
| `/manage/fake` | `200` | same |
| `/intake/fake` | `200` | same |
| `/portal/verify/fake` | `200` | same |
| `/calendar-feed/fake.ics` | `404` (no real token) | same |

## Quick gates a reviewer can run

```bash
# Stripe dormancy
git diff | grep -E '^\+' | \
  grep -E 'paymentIntents\.create|charges\.create|refunds\.create|checkout\.sessions|set_studio_require_card_on_file|STRIPE_ALLOW_LIVE_MODE=true'

# Em-dashes in added lines
git diff -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.sql' | grep -E '^\+' | grep -c '-'

# Static stripe imports that aren't behind the existing key gate
grep -rn '@stripe/' --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' . | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .next
```

## What the harness cannot verify

When opening a PR, the report MUST explicitly call out which smoke steps were not run. Items that always require manual execution (until automated tests exist):

- Anything requiring the practitioner session cookie (`/calendar/[id]`, `/settings/*`, the in-app actions).
- Anything requiring a real Resend send to a real inbox.
- Anything requiring a real Twilio SMS to a real phone number.
- Anything requiring a real Stripe test charge against the connected account.
- Anything requiring a real client portal session cookie.
- Anything requiring the Vercel production env dashboard.
