  -- THE OPEN ROUND, NOT EVERY ROUND THIS STUDIO HAS EVER HAD. `studio_id` was
  -- the primary key of this table when the line below was written, so
  -- `where r.studio_id = ...` named exactly one row. It no longer does: the key
  -- is now `id`, closed rounds persist as an append-mostly ledger, and at most
  -- one open round per studio is enforced by a PARTIAL unique index
  -- `(studio_id) where closed_at is null`. Without the predicate this statement
  -- would still take a lock -- it has no `found` check and never decided
  -- anything -- but it would take FOR UPDATE on every historical row, so
  -- admission contention would grow with the studio's history and the order
  -- named above would no longer describe a round.
  --
  -- THE PREDICATE IS THE ISSUER'S, CHARACTER FOR CHARACTER. 0192's
  -- issue_scoped_new_client_waitlist_invitation selects
  -- `where r.studio_id = p_studio_id and r.closed_at is null for update`, and
  -- this lock is only useful if it names the same row that command will.

  -- FOR UPDATE, NOT FOR NO KEY UPDATE, unlike the studios lock above. This row
  -- is the TARGET of the invitation's composite (admission_round_id, studio_id)
  -- foreign key, so a competing issuance needs KEY SHARE on it. FOR UPDATE
  -- excludes KEY SHARE and that exclusion is precisely what serialises the
  -- allowance seat; NO KEY UPDATE here would let two issuances past.
  --
  -- LOCK-ONLY, WITH NO VERDICT. `no_round_open` belongs to 0192 and is returned

  -- 3b. THE SERVICE MUST BE ONE A NEW CLIENT MAY ACTUALLY BOOK.
  --
  -- BEFORE THE SUBTRANSACTION, so no claim is taken and unwound -- this refusal
  -- leaves no durable state at all rather than relying on a rollback to remove
  -- it. 0192's issuer checks that the service EXISTS and belongs to the studio;
  -- it does not ask whether a new client may book it, and that migration is not
  -- this lane's to change.
  --
  -- AFTER the studio, round and entry decisions, so every existing refusal
  -- keeps its precedence: unknown_studio, not_found and not_admissible are
  -- still answered first and none of their meanings move.
  --
  -- `invalid_service` IS THE EXISTING WORD for it, carried from 0192's own
  -- vocabulary. A new code would make callers learn a second name for "that
  -- service cannot be offered", and the recipient-facing outcome is identical.
  --
  -- Tenancy is the query filter here, which is why the predicate does not take
  -- a studio id: a row fetched without `studio_id` is already the wrong row.
  -- A missing row therefore also refuses, covering an unknown or deleted id.
  -- READ UNDER A LOCK THAT OUTLIVES THE DECISION. An unlocked `exists` check
  -- decided eligibility against a snapshot the owner could change before the
  -- nested issuer committed: deactivate the service, or retitle it, and the
  -- invitation was still minted against the stale verdict. The lock is held to
  -- COMMIT, so the row the decision rests on cannot move underneath it.
  --
  -- FOR SHARE, AND THE MODE IS THE POINT.
  --
  --   * FOR KEY SHARE WOULD NOT WORK AND LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD. `active`,
  --     `modality` and `name` are NON-KEY columns, so an ordinary UPDATE of them
  --     takes FOR NO KEY UPDATE -- which KEY SHARE does not conflict with.
  --     Protecting the service's KEY protects nothing this predicate reads.
  --   * FOR SHARE is the NARROWEST mode that does conflict with FOR NO KEY
  --     UPDATE, so it blocks every eligibility-changing UPDATE and any DELETE.
  --   * FOR UPDATE / FOR NO KEY UPDATE would ALSO work and are worse: they
  --     exclude each other, so two admissions naming the SAME service would
  --     serialise on it. They should contend for the round seat, not for a row
  --     neither of them writes. FOR SHARE admits both.
  --   * AND FOR SHARE DOES NOT BLOCK FK KEY-SHARE CHECKS. An appointment
  --     referencing this service requests FOR KEY SHARE, which FOR SHARE
  --     permits -- so holding this lock cannot stall an ordinary booking. Same
  --     reasoning that chose NO KEY UPDATE for the studios row above, applied to
  --     the other side of the matrix.
  --
  -- LOCK ORDER STEP 4: services comes LAST, after the entry, and no existing
  -- writer inverts it. Every service mutation -- the settings UPDATE, the
  -- active toggle, show_studio_service and reorder_studio_service -- locks
  -- service rows and NOTHING this command holds, so none of them can be waiting
  -- on the studio, round or entry while this command waits on them. No cycle
