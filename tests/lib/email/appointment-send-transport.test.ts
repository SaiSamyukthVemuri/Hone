// ===========================================================================
// RESCHEDULE-E2E-01 — the appointment send path resolves a FAKEABLE transport.
// ===========================================================================
//
// THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `sendEmailSafely` imported the raw `resend` client from
// lib/email/client.ts instead of calling `getResendTransport()`. The onboarding
// path already used the resolver, so a fake transport existed and worked — but
// every appointment email, including the public-reschedule confirmation, went
// around it and reached the real Resend SDK. Under the E2E lane that meant a
// live HTTPS request to api.resend.com carrying `re_dummy_resend_key`, and
// `e2e/public-reschedule-v2.spec.ts` asserted the failure copy that the
// provider's rejection happened to produce. When that external behaviour
// changed, the same tree began failing with no code change.
//
// These tests exercise the REAL resolver, not a mocked module: the only thing
// stubbed is the server-only marker the fake itself reads. A mock of
// `@/lib/email/client` could pass while the real path reached a different
// transport, which is exactly how the bypass survived.
